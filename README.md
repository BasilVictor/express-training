# 2 - Routes

In here we will start creating some APIs according to our use case.

## Installing Dependencies

We will use npm to install packages.

```
npm install mysql2
```

## Creating routes

First we create a routes directory, and inside that an `index.js` file. The file contents must be like the one in this repository. We also modify `app.js` file. Also create the other files as per the repository.

## Understanding the Project Structure

- `routes` directory, contains all the routes
- `routes/home.js` handles the home page
- `routes/api` handles all the apis, for now we only have `/api/posts`, as apis increases files increase in this directory.
